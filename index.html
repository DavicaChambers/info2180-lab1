 <p> I was previously majoring in Actuarial Science. I decided to switch to Computer Science because I was enjoying my computing courses way more than my others. I played chess for my high school 
and my country however, sadly, I no longer enjoy playing. I am interested in Web Development because I think it's so cool.  </p>
